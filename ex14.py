"""
Attempting to solve exercise 14:
A BMI below 18.5 is considered thin, 18.5-25 normal, and 25+ overweight (fat)

Notes:
havent made the "main()" formatting
output needs to be cleaned up so you can tell what percentage is what
Directory needs to be fixed
The BMI calculation could be added as a method for the person class,
that way we could skip it here, should be simple since every person has a weight and height already
