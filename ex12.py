"""
Attempting to solve exercise 12:
Average height for men = 181,4 +- 3 cm
Average height for women = 167,2 +- 3 cm
Tall and short are above and below those limits respectively

Notes;
Using some of the same coding from ex7
directory needs fixing to github direct
Extra note:
It seems like the somewhat randomization of the dataset has made the average height of women a lot higher than whats typical,
So maybe there should not be any differentiation between men and women in terms of what is consiudered tall
